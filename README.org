#+TITLE: Sunpower
#+DESCRIPTION: Unofficial tests of apparent Sunpower API

[[https://codeclimate.com/github/jeffkowalski/sunpower/badges/gpa.svg]]

Updated to use the more current API, the same that is used by https://sds.mysunpower.com/monitor/.

In this version, we simply log the current production and timestamp to influxdb.
However, by modifying the query, other responses are possible.

The code is informed by [[https://gist.githubusercontent.com/koleson/d78da48497575455b9be6a3c96951bd1/raw/2a76b391f0f53e27b1b82700c4a9e897ea99ed9e/sunpower_ess_mode_set.sh][a script written by Kiel Koleson]]
